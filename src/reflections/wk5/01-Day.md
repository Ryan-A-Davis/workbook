# Node Servers and Query Strings...and You

## What is the purpose of a query string? 
A query string is used to find specific data in a database. It makes it easy to just ask a the database specifically what you are looking for.
## What is the format of a query parameter? How does is start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
The format of a query parameter always starts with a questnon mark, followed by a key value pair. This pair is seperated by an equals sign.

## When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your servers?
They would be helpful when you have data that you wish to categorize, or modulate in some way. It also helps to have query parameters when working with very large amounts of data.
