# Day three, tempted to cheat...at DESIGN

## What is your favorite design tip that you think is most beneficial to improving your design?
The tip about easily changing your fonts. My fonts are all basic, and I find it difficult to make any of the text on my pages distinguishable from anything else.

## A few resources that are examples of good design
Sansfrancisco has been my favorite design resource to use.They have everything from stock photos to use, to different typograpies and color palletes. Its a one stop shop for web-design.

## How do you think kfgood design influences people when visitinig a web-page, and what sorts of things does design convey on its own?
I think a well designed page will stick out in a users memory. Design is the first thing users notice a bout a page, and it conveys how much time and effort a designer put into that page, and the level of quality didn't come without significant time, thought and consideration.
