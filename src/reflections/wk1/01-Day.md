## What is Git, and why is it an essential tool for modern developers?
Git is an open source development tool that streamlines collaboration between mulitple developers working on the same project. It has multiple tools that assist in building complex applications such as; the ability to create repositories for storing code, as well as methods for tracking changes made to existing code in those repositories, and keeping a working history of all prior versions of the code in these repositories - along with many other useful attributes. This allows fluid transitions between builds of code, as well as a failsafe for developers to be able to easily access prior builds in the event updated builds have unforseen bugs or issues. This open source system has redefined how development teams can colloborate on large scale projects from anywhere in the world.


## What is a branch, and why are they useful?

A branch is a pointer to the latest bit of code commited to a Git repository. This pointer allows for parallel development of applications, as well as ways to test multiple builds of a project at once.


## Git vs Git Hub, and why it matters.

Git is the actual application that is used to create files and repositories for developers to then share to the GitHub. The hub is a website where developers can share their created repositories, and crowd source development efforts within an online coummunity.
