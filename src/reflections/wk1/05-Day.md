# Week one in the books...

##
Over all this week I feel like I have learned quite a bit. I still struggle with positioning of elements, and my styling is atrocious, but I guess that is to be expected when first stating out at anything. I am thankful for the guidance I rev=cieved from the staff on my syntax errors, because it was not fun spending an hour trying to get an element to move, not knowing what was wrong, when all it took was another dash in my code and everything lined up the way it was supposed to! I am definitely enjoying the process (even though I don't think I have eve been more frustrated with myself in my life), and I am looking forward to the challenges of the upcoming weeks. Hopefully we will get to back end soon, because my design skills are, at this point, non-existant.
