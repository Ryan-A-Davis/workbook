# Building with blocks. And wires!

## What is the purpose of wire framing?
Wire framing allows designers to visualize a page before they get started on its code. Its very helpful to have a visual representation for what you are going for design-wise, and it will help a designer work more efficiently when it gets time to actually code the site.

## What are the difference levels in detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
There are high fidelity wire frames, and low fidelity wire frames. High fidelity are useful for when you not only want to plot out the structure of a page, but also overall design and funtionality of the page/site. Low fidelity frames are useful when designers need to just mock up the structure of a webpage, so they can get to working on it quickly.

## Are wire-frames worth it?
I believe they are definitely worth taking the time to do. As someone who does not have the "eye" for design, being able to actually visualize a plan helps tremendously when it comes time to actually build the layout of my page in the code.
