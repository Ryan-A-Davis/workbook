## The final Project


# Monday

Today I was working on trying to get past the last no-auth and invalid auth tests. I got hung up on one of my gets not returning an instance of the object that was expected to come back. I threw in debuggers throughout the route path, and could not for the life of me find where the issue was. I decided to take a break from the back end and start building out my srvices in the front end.

# Tuesday

This was the first day back at javascript for me since the capstone project. After such a long break, I was glad for the forgiving nature of the language, as I'm sure most of my issues stemmed from syntax errors! It took me the better part of the morning to get back in the flow of vue, and I got done as much as I could not having my servver 100% done yet.

# Wednesday

HELP! Tpday was the first day I asked for direct help from one of the staff members on the project. I don't know why I thought that I was not supposed to ask ANY questions throughout the process, but I finally was hung up on my server for long enough that I was seriously concerned about even finishing the project. Hopefully it isn't too late....

# Thursday

Ok...this is the third day in a row where I have slept for less than 4 hours. The code is starting to blur...things are moving I feel, at a snails pace. I am starting to wonder if I made a huge mistake, trying to figure out everything on my own, without utilizing the resources that I had avaiable to me.

# Friday

The last day. The moment of truth. After a week of literally coding every waking moment, I finally have crossed the finish line. It was down to the wire, and my nerves were shot by the end of the week, but I learned a valuable lesson through this entire process. It's not that you shouldn't ask questions, but that you shouldn't ask BAD questions. Take the time to understand the issue you are having, and be able to articulate it to your senior, so they can best assist you through your issues. I have learned to be more open to asking for guidance, and not try to be on an island trying to write perfect, bug-free code (this is a silly thing to expect of oneself).
