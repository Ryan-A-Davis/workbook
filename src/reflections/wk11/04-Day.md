# Final Lecture

##
This course has definitely pushed me outside of my comfort zone.  has been a grueling challenge, and has grown me exponentially as a problem solver, and a programmer. I plan to focus on getting all of the tests to at least the required passes first. Then, I will skeleton out the front end to recieve the data from the server, and start connecting them. Once that is done, struggle to match the figma for a few days. I have really enjoyed the firesides, particularly whiteboard wednesdays. Although I only went up two or three times, it was always a fun challenge.
