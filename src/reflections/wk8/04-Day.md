# Vue Testing

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in vue? What does each method provide?
The three types of testing are unit testing, component testing, and E2E (end to end) testing. Unit testing tests individual blocks of code in isolation. Component testing allows you to test an individul components functionality. E2E testing gives you a picture of what a user will see when using your app.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I feel like E2E testing is the most useful way to test. It is the best way to see how you can possibly brake the product as a whole.  

## What testing method do you think is least useful? Why?

I think unit testing is the least useful. In the Vue framework, it seems redundant compared to component testing.
