# Beware, of Little Bobby DROP TABLES

## In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
You can think of the row as the keys for the values in the column. Or if you like, the headings for a table vs the contents.

## Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id. 
First you would use the CREATE method to name the table. After naming it, you would open a set of parentheses and declare the names of the rows, and the value type  for the columns that match those rows.

## What is the difference between the following statements: DELETE FROM table; and DROP TABLE table;?

DELETE FROM table is a command that clears data out of a table. DROP TABLE table will delete the instance of the table, along with all the data contained within it.
