## Intro to CSharp

# What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
The three categories of data types are pointer data types, value data types, and reference datatypes. Value and reference data types actually take up space in memory, while pointer types point to a value and don't physically take up space in memory. 

# What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Int (or any other form of number type), char, and bool are value types built in to C#. In JavaScript, nothing is strictly typed, so you can eaasily convert a variable from one type to the next. 

# In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Reference types are stored as an address where one can find the data they are looking for in memory. Value types are stored in an address, and when you reference it you are shpwing up at the datas doorstep.
