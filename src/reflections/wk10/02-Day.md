## What is a List in C#?
A list is a datatype that stores values in a 0 indexed collection. It is more flexable than an aaray, but doess not have access to a .length property.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
Add, Remove, Contains, Find and FindIndex seem to be pretty useful methods. I would imaginfe that working with lists, these methods would allow you to track your data much easier than an array with a set number of values. 

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
I would use the .Find list method to get what I needed from the list. You could also retrieve multiple values if you needed to with the .GetRange function.
