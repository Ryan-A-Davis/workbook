# Rest...

## What does rest stand for, and in simple terms, what does it mean?
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It means that the client recieves a representation of the tate of the API.
## What does Stateless mean?
It means that the API does not store information about the user who accessed the API. Each individual request contains all the info the server needs to give a response.

## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
I did not find the answer to this question in the reading. I am guessing it has something to do with the structure the URLs take on when making specific requests, that return data based on a name or id number, or other identifying marker.
