# Async, Await

## What is the purpose of an async/await function?
Async await functions were introduced to simplify the chaining of promises. They help to alleviate the "Callback hell" problem.

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside a function?
First you must decalare the client side function as an await function. The async keyword tells the function to expect a promise within it's scope.


## What are some of the primary benefits of async/await?
Debugging becomes more simple when you can read the code in the parseable chunks async await allows. Multiple async functions can be chained together, without it taking up half a page of code.
