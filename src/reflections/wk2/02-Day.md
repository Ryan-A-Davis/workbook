#What are the three ways to syntatically write a function, and are they different in any way?

##The first way is the standard way to write a function. You declare it with a let or var keyword, name it, and pass it arguments if it needs them. The second way is to use arrow notation. This utilizes the lambda symbol, and is shorthand for most for loop functions. 

##What is the difference between parameters and arguments?
Arguments are what go into a function. A parameter is what an argument becomes when it is utilized by the function.

##What is a higer order function? Can you give an example of one?
A higher order function is one that takes other functions as arguments, and returns them as parameters. For example a function that updates a screen, may take in a function that changes values on the screen as an argument, and returns those values from another function after manipulating them and drawing them to the screen.
