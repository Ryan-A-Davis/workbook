#Week 2 Day One


##What is scope?
Scope is the amount of code a variable is relavent in. For instance there is global scope, which means the variable is available to hte whole document. Or there is local scope, or block scope, when a variable is only relavent in the block of code it was declared in.

##What is hoisting?
Hoisting is when javascript lifts a variable declaration aas high as it's scope will allow on reading. This helps cut down on undefined errors in code.

##When might you use let instead of the var keyword?
I would say that if you are passing an argument to a function, var is more useful because it names a variable one consistent type. Let is more versatile and doesn't need to have a type declared.
