## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We are using sockets and mvc design. We are also utilizing google maps api to get location data.

So far the things that have went well have been the overall design. The design of the app has also made it very easy to split up workloads and mimimize merge conflicts.

## What would you do differently? Why?
I think  Iwould allow more time to partner program. Partner programmimg is a great way to collaborate, and keep erros to a minimium.
