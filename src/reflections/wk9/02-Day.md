# Week 9 day 2

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
With a small team, the responsibilities are bigger in regards to the project. A larger team would have more resources, and thus moore responsibilities stretched across the team.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
To help focus the efforts of the team. One goal is better to perform well, then splitting attetntion between many.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
The unattainable triangle reminds us to focus on what is the most important.Things cannot have all 3 sides of the triangle, teams need to focus on the two that make the most sense for the project.
