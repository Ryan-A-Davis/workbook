Encapsulation is blocking code into reusable chunks, and maintaining privacy in your application via closures or class fields.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?

```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

The mvc pattern is used to keep tight control over the app state and to develop and maintain, clean self documented code. 
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

The controller is used to draw elements to the page, as well as to connect the DOM to the service file.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

The service conducts all of the business logic of the application.

**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

The model is used as a representation of an object archetype. Think of it as blueprints for an object, and instances of this blueprint is the object itself.
