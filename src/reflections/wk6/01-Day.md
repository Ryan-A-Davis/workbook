# The Vue from the Top

## What is component based architecture?

It is a method for encapsulating pieces of a large/complex user interface. It focuses on small areas of a U/I (components) and encapsulates all concerns within the same component vertically in the same file. This strategy is to help with readability over large applications, but if a single component gets very complex, it may hinder reusability and readability. 

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

You can break down a large, complex app into its features, and code them independently of eachother. CBA is vertically integrated, so each component is self contained and completing an app is simply linking all components together.

## What are some drawbacks to CBA?

If there are many different components to an application, it can hinder the readability of the application as a whole. It becomes easy to treat every aspect of an application as a component, when it isn't necessary. This can lead to over-engineered or self indulgent code.
