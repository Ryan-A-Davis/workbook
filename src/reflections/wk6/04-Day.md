# Re-routing

## What is a nested route?
A route that is the child of another route. A route can have multiple children.
## When might you use a nested route?
You might use a nested route when you have one page that can potentially lead to many. Or when you have two different pages that would navigate to the same page.
## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes you can. When creating a path between multiple pages.
